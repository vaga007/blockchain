# Blockchain bare-bones

## About

This app is a bare-bones blockchain app to demystify the whole idea.

## To spin up nodes
```
npm run nodeA
npm run nodeB

```

## Few points to note

* This app has a static configuration for the number of leading zeroes to be present in a valid hash at any point in time, unlike Bitcoin.

* The app will have a UI for block exploration in a future version.
